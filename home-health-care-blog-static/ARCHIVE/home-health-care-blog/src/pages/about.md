We are a Medicare-certified home health agency serving the greater Bay Area. Our nurses, therapists, aides, and social workers bring hospital-level care into comfortable living rooms.

## Our Mission

- Teach families practical skills so they feel confident between visits.
- Coordinate services quickly so no one waits for help.

## Service Area
We provide in-home visits across Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. Rural visits may be coordinated in partnership with trusted agencies.

## Accreditations
- Joint Commission Gold Seal of Approval
- Medicare Conditions of Participation compliant
- State Department of Public Health licensed

## Leadership Team
Our interdisciplinary leadership team includes:
- **Emily Chen, RN, MSN** – Administrator and Director of Patient Care Services
- **Marcus Rivera, PT, DPT** – Rehabilitation Director
- **Aisha Thompson, MSW, LCSW** – Director of Social Services

## How We Work
1. **Referral & Eligibility Review** – We confirm Medicare coverage, physician orders, and homebound status.
2. **Start of Care Visit** – A nurse completes the OASIS assessment and builds the plan of care.
3. **Team Collaboration** – Therapists, aides, and social workers follow the plan, updating goals every 60 days.
4. **Family Education** – We leave behind simple checklists, exercise sheets, and emergency contacts.
